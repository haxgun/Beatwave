Valory provides a beautiful rank overlay for your stream.
Overlay under the hood runs on vanilla JS, so it has minimal load on your PC.

Project was inspired by the work of [davizeragod](https://davizeragod.github.io/) and [tracker.gg/overlays](https://tracker.gg/overlays).
Initially, the project was a fork of [davizeragod](https://davizeragod.github.io/), but then it began to exist as a separate project.

## ‚ú® Features

- Overlay runs on vanilla JS
- Beautiful, modern design
- It has the possibility of customization. For example, changing the color of components or removing unnecessary components
